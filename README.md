## General Info

As a project using my first API, I wanted to create a cocktail guide for individuals who are looking to change things up with their drinks at home. This entire project was coded from scratch, as well as the JavaScript.

With having wanted to employ the use of modals, I followed a Traversy Media tutorial in how to create them within this application. The link can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0). Once understanding the basics, I modified what I had learned so it would apply more appropriately to the vision in my head.

This API challenged me, as it had a fairly complex object return and I wanted to showcase the entirity of the recipe to the users. It required the utilization of many loops, the creation of elements within said loops and excluding any returns that were blank within the API. In addition, I had to make sure that the photos that were returned were an appropriate size and not too overwhelming for handheld devices.

Overall, this project turned out miles ahead of what I expected for my first API use, and I learned a lot in the process.

## Technologies
